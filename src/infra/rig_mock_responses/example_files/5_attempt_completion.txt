<thinking>
Now I have a good understanding of both data sources:

1. user.csv contains user data with columns: id, organization_id, user_name, email, join_date, role
2. org.json contains organization data with columns: created_at, id, industry, location, name

I need to:
1. Join users with organizations on organization_id = id
2. Filter for users with role = 'member'
3. Count the number of members per organization
4. Include the organization name in the results

I have all the information needed to create the final query.
</thinking>

Now I'll create the query to count the number of users with the role 'member' in each organization by joining the user and organization data.

<attempt_completion>
<query>
SELECT
    o."name" AS organization_name,
    COUNT(*) AS member_count
FROM 'example/user.csv' u
JOIN 'example/org.json' o ON u."organization_id" = o."id"
WHERE u."role" = 'member'
GROUP BY o."name"
ORDER BY member_count DESC
</query>
</attempt_completion>
