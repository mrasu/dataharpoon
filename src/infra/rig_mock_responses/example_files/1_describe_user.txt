The user wants to know the number of users with the role 'member' in each organization. I need to:

1. First, examine the structure of the user.csv file to understand its schema
2. Then examine the org.json file to understand its schema
3. Join these data sources to count users with role 'member' per organization

Let me start by examining the user.csv file structure.
