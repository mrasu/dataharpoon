The user is asking for the current time in San Francisco in Japanese. They want to know "サンフランシスコの現在時間を知りたい" which translates to "I want to know the current time in San Francisc the available tools, I can see there's an MCP server called "time" with a tool called "get_current_time" that can get the current time in specific timezones. This seems like the perfect tool for this task.

However, I need to check the input schema for this tool first to understand what parameters it requires. I should query the information_schema.mcp_tools table to get the input schema for the get_current_time tool.

I'll help you get the current time in San Francisco. First, let me check the available time tools to understand the required parameters.

<run_query>
<query>SELECT input_schema FROM information_schema.mcp_tools WHERE server_name = 'time' AND tool_name = 'get_current_time'</query>
</run_query>

Please confirm the result of this tool use so I can proceed with the next step.
